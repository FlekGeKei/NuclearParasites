# INTRODUCTION

You need to survive. Humanity is extinct.

But in this world you have some zombies witch can destroy your home, explode your home, drive creepers to your home. Worry about damage, you can bleed and zombies smell it. They little bit smarter than in vanilla and use sunscreen.

Also, to this broken world was coming not only zombies, parasites joined this party, too. In firsts stages of your gameplay, they can't make big problems. But step by step they evolve and going to be the strongest life form. [(see more here)](https://scape-and-run-parasites.fandom.com/wiki/Scape_and_Run:_Parasites_Wiki)

BUT you may have a brain. You can make weapons. You can defend yourself.

# Tips

- After installing mods by [File Director](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft-The-Final-Frontier/FileDirector#:~:text=Modrinth%20Mod%20Download-,Previews,-%3B) close modpack and start again. It will turn on mods installed by File Director and solve some performance issues and bugs.

- To reload guns from NTM, you need to press Ctrl+R.

- For no reasons, you can't do some actions (like dropping items) before opening inventory in new login/session.

- Don't even try to press F3+C, it will crush the game.

# SOMETHING'S

Also, if I successfully compile Oculus for 1.12.2, I'll add Oculus to the modpack...
